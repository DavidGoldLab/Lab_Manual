# Welcome

This manual will help get you up to speed on the computational tools used in the [Gold Lab](www.DavidAdlerGold.com) 

This manual is broken into "modules" that introduce basic concepts and tools. By the time you are done you will learn the following things:

- Navigate your computer and manipulate text using command line
- Access genetic databases and search for relevant sequences
- Annotate and format genetic data
- Make gene/protein alignments
- Produce phylogenetic and gene trees (WIP)

These modules assume you are using a Mac operating system (OSX). OSX is built on UNIX, so if are using a Linux operating system the commands and guide should be very similar. If you are using a Windows OS things will be trickier, but I am developing workarounds. If you are running into problems please contact me.

The list of currently available modules are displayed on the left side of the screen. You can get started by choosing "__Lesson 0: Configuring your computer__". This first lesson will probably take you the longest because it requires installing programs and potentially updating your operating system. Additional modules should take ~1hr to complete.

```{tip}
I strongly recommend preparing a "cheat sheet" with the things you learned. Try not to just copy and paste all of the code; practice it until you feel comfortable.
